# CLAUDE.md

Context for Claude Code sessions working in this repo. Keep this short — it's a
reference for fast orientation, not documentation. Full setup/usage detail lives
in README.md.

## Project overview

HuntLoop, today, is a Greenhouse job-board scraper (Scrapy) that pipes postings
into a Postgres database via SQLAlchemy. That's the whole built system: scrape
Greenhouse's public API → normalize into `JobPostingItem` → `JobDataPipeline`
upserts companies/sources/postings/locations/skills.

Broader vision (not yet built): aggregate job postings across many sources, and
add sponsorship-aware matching so candidates can filter for companies that
actually sponsor visas (e.g. H1B). Treat anything beyond the Greenhouse pipeline
above as planned, not present.

## Tech stack and conventions

- Package root: `huntloop` lives under `src/` (`src/huntloop/...`). Anything
  importing it needs `src/` on `sys.path` (see `main.py`, `pytest.ini`).
- Config: `.env` (gitignored) + `python-dotenv`, loaded in `settings.py`. Never
  hardcode credentials — `.env.example` documents the required shape.
- Migrations: Alembic, config at repo root (`alembic.ini`, `alembic/`).
- Tests: pytest, config at repo root (`pytest.ini`), tests live in `tests/`.
- Entrypoint: `python main.py` runs the Greenhouse scraper end-to-end.
- Docker: `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` (app + postgres:18) for a
  dev-oriented containerized setup. Not hardened for production. CI
  (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs migrations + pytest against a real
  Postgres service container on every push/PR to `master`.
- One-off scripts live in `scripts/` (not part of the ongoing app pipeline
  or CI) — e.g. `scripts/ingest_lca_disclosures.py`, run manually. Uses
  `pandas`/`openpyxl` (in `requirements.txt`) to read DOL's `.xlsx`
  disclosure files from `data/raw/dol_lca/` (gitignored — see SESSIONS.md's
  Step 1 audit for how those files are obtained; they're downloaded
  manually, not fetched by any code in this repo).
- Logging: `src/huntloop/logging_config.py`'s `setup_logging()` is the
  single source of logging configuration (format, level, console + rotating
  `logs/huntloop.log` file handler) — every module gets its logger via
  plain `logging.getLogger(__name__)` and relies on this having already
  run. Level is controlled by the `LOG_LEVEL` env var (default `INFO`), not
  hardcoded per-module. `logs/` is gitignored (runtime artifact).

## Key architectural decisions (already made — don't re-litigate)

- **`job_url` is the canonical unique key** on `job_postings`, not `gh_job_id`.
  `gh_job_id` isn't reliably unique and won't generalize to non-Greenhouse
  sources later.
- **`Company.h1b_sponsorship` is intentionally kept** even though it's a bare
  boolean today. It will likely be superseded by real sponsorship data —
  `LcaDisclosure` (`lca_disclosures` table) now holds raw DOL LCA disclosure
  records with `employer_name_normalized` populated for every row (see
  `src/huntloop/matching/normalize.py`), `find_matching_employers()`
  (`src/huntloop/matching/fuzzy_match.py`) ranks candidate
  `employer_name_normalized` values against a raw company name, and
  `get_sponsorship_summary()` (`src/huntloop/matching/sponsorship.py`)
  applies that to a real `Company` row to answer "does this company
  sponsor, and how much." Don't "fix" `h1b_sponsorship` in the meantime by
  removing or redesigning it unprompted.
- **There is deliberately no FK from `companies` to `lca_disclosures`.**
  `get_sponsorship_summary()` computes the match at call time via
  `find_matching_employers()` instead of a stored link — a company can span
  multiple legal entities in the LCA data, and match confidence varies row
  to row, so a rigid one-to-one FK would be premature normalization. Don't
  add that FK unprompted; if it's ever needed, that's a deliberate future
  decision, not a "fix" for this being "incomplete."
- **`normalize_employer_name()` (`src/huntloop/matching/normalize.py`) is
  mechanical normalization only** — uppercase, strip periods/commas,
  collapse whitespace, drop a trailing legal-entity suffix
  (`INC`/`LLC`/`LLP`/`LP`/`CORP`/`CO`/`LTD`/`PLLC`/`PC`). It is not full
  entity resolution and deliberately does not merge companies beyond that
  (e.g. it won't collapse `LIMITED`-suffixed names or handle abbreviation/
  alias matching). Don't expand its suffix list or scope unprompted — see
  the false-positive-risk test in `tests/test_normalize.py` for why it
  stays conservative.
- **`find_matching_employers()` (`src/huntloop/matching/fuzzy_match.py`)
  checks `sponsor_name_overrides` before fuzzy matching, and short-circuits
  if a confirmed mapping exists.** Fuzzy matching uses `rapidfuzz`'s
  `token_set_ratio` (not `WRatio` — `WRatio`'s partial-ratio component
  scores the audit's flagged false positive, "INFOSYS" vs.
  "A&A INFOSYSTEMS", at 90, indistinguishable from a true match) at a
  default threshold of 88, chosen empirically against real
  `lca_disclosures` data (see SESSIONS.md for the concrete scores). It does
  not eliminate every collision between unrelated companies sharing a
  generic industry-suffix word (e.g. "... CONSULTANCY SERVICES",
  "... INFOSYSTEMS") — that residual ambiguity is what
  `sponsor_name_overrides` is for. `sponsor_name_overrides` is still empty
  — for both companies checked so far (`checkr`, `duolingo`), fuzzy
  matching alone was already unambiguous and verified correct, so no
  override was needed yet; don't assume the table has real entries in it.
- **Test isolation uses a throwaway Postgres schema per test session**, not
  `pytest-postgresql`. Reuses the existing local Postgres server rather than
  spinning up a separate instance. See `tests/conftest.py`.
- **`JobPosting.location` was dropped** in favor of the `job_locations` child
  table, which is the canonical one-to-many representation.
- **`alembic upgrade head` is the sole source of schema creation.** The
  pipeline and `test_db_insert.py` used to fall back to
  `Base.metadata.create_all()`, which could silently create tables outside
  Alembic's bookkeeping and caused a real `alembic_version` drift incident
  (see SESSIONS.md). That fallback is gone — don't re-add it. (Exception:
  `tests/conftest.py` still uses `create_all()`, but only to build tables in
  pytest's throwaway per-session schema, a separate test-isolation
  mechanism, not app schema creation.)
- **Scrapy's own logging is intentionally disabled** (`LOG_ENABLED = False`
  in `settings.py`) so `huntloop.logging_config.setup_logging()` is the only
  thing configuring the root logger — Scrapy's internal log lines (e.g.
  `scrapy.core.engine`) still show up, just formatted by our handlers
  instead of Scrapy's own. Don't re-enable `LOG_ENABLED` or set a Scrapy
  `LOG_LEVEL` — that would produce duplicate log lines (Scrapy's handler
  plus ours, both attached to root). `src/huntloop/test_db_insert.py` still
  has its own separate `logging.basicConfig()` + emoji-prefixed messages —
  intentionally left alone (it's a manual smoke-test script, not part of
  the shared-logging migration).

## How to run things

See README.md for full detail (setup, running the scraper, migrations, tests).
Short version: `python main.py` (scraper), `pytest` (tests), `alembic upgrade
head` (migrations).

## Current phase / what's next

Phase 0 (repo hygiene / foundations) is done: env config extraction, Alembic
setup, schema-drift reconciliation, small bug fixes, pytest scaffold,
README, Docker (app + Postgres via docker-compose), and a minimal CI
workflow (migrations + pytest against a real Postgres service on every
push/PR).

Phase 1 (sponsorship-matching MVP) core is now done, as of 2026-08-20:
DOL LCA disclosure files were audited and ingested (11 fiscal-year/quarter
files, 1,431,321 rows in `lca_disclosures`, via
`scripts/ingest_lca_disclosures.py`); every row has a mechanically
normalized `employer_name_normalized` (`normalize_employer_name()`, 108,575
distinct values vs. 129,295 distinct raw `employer_name` values); fuzzy
matching (`find_matching_employers()`, `rapidfuzz`-based, with a
`sponsor_name_overrides` manual-correction escape hatch) resolves a raw
company name to likely `employer_name_normalized` candidates; and
`get_sponsorship_summary()` applies that to a real `Company` row and
returns an aggregated sponsorship picture (total approved LCAs by fiscal
year, distinct job titles, distinct worksite states). Verified end-to-end
against both currently-scraped companies (`checkr`: 48 approved LCAs
2021-2025; `duolingo`: 95 approved LCAs 2021-2025) — both matches manually
confirmed correct, no override needed. Shared logging
(`src/huntloop/logging_config.py`, `LOG_LEVEL`-controlled, console +
rotating file) is also in place across the scraper, pipeline, and scripts.
See SESSIONS.md for the full log.

Not yet started / explicitly deferred: broader scraper coverage (only
`checkr` and `duolingo` are configured), any UI/API surface for
`get_sponsorship_summary()` (it's a Python function today, called
directly, not exposed via an endpoint or the scraper pipeline), curating
`sponsor_name_overrides` for companies fuzzy matching doesn't resolve
cleanly (table is still empty), broader test coverage, scraper
parsing/HTTP tests, CI linting/build/deploy steps, multi-source
aggregation beyond Greenhouse, and any FK from `companies` to
`lca_disclosures` (deliberately not built — see the architectural
decisions above). Nothing beyond what's listed above should be assumed
built.
